# A_Life_Generative_Design
List of 3 MATLAB programs that can import STL geomerty and alter it based on 3 biologically inspired processes:

- Leaf venation - using simulated auxin particles to extrude veins from the face of a flat part

- Slime mold - inspired by  single celled organism that can branch out and explore an enviroment

- Particle swarm- inspired by both robotic projects and fire ants that form rafts with their bodies, a particle swarm will travel over the body of a mechanical component and distribute relative to stress concentrations of said component
